# Loan-Management-System-SQL-Project-
This project simulates a loan management system for a financial institution. It involves designing a relational database to manage customer information, loan applications, and payments. The system helps track loan status, analyze payments, identify overdue accounts, and generate meaningful financial insights.

Goal of the Project:
To simulate how a bank or NBFC (like DCB Bank or SMFG) manages:

-> Customers who apply for loans
-> Loan disbursement
-> Monthly payments (EMIs)
-> Overdue or delinquent payments
-> Financial reports for business insights
